///
/// ### Priority
/// This example shows how to always prioritize the left stream.
///
/// ```rust
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// use futures::stream::{ repeat, select_with_strategy, PollNext, StreamExt, ExitStrategy };
///
/// let left = repeat(1);
/// let right = repeat(2);
///
/// // We don't need any state, so let's make it an empty tuple.
/// // We must provide some type here, as there is no way for the compiler
/// // to infer it. As we don't need to capture variables, we can just
/// // use a function pointer instead of a closure.
/// fn prio_left(_: &mut ()) -> PollNext { PollNext::Left }
///
/// let mut out = select_with_strategy(left, right, prio_left, ExitStrategy::WhenBothFinish);
///
/// for _ in 0..100 {
///     // Whenever we poll out, we will always get `1`.
///     assert_eq!(1, out.select_next_some().await);
/// }
/// # });
/// ```
///
/// ### Round Robin
/// This example shows how to select from both streams round robin.
/// Note: this special case is provided by [`futures-util::stream::select`].
///
/// ```rust
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async {
/// use futures::stream::{ repeat, select_with_strategy, FusedStream, PollNext, StreamExt, ExitStrategy };
///
/// // Finishes when both streams finish
/// {
///     let left = repeat(1).take(10);
///     let right = repeat(2);
///
///     let rrobin = |last: &mut PollNext| last.toggle();
///
///     let mut out = select_with_strategy(left, right, rrobin, ExitStrategy::WhenBothFinish);
///
///     for _ in 0..10 {
///         // We should be alternating now.
///         assert_eq!(1, out.select_next_some().await);
///         assert_eq!(2, out.select_next_some().await);
///     }
///     for _ in 0..100 {
///         // First stream has finished
///         assert_eq!(2, out.select_next_some().await);
///     }
///     assert!(!out.is_terminated());
/// }
///
/// // Finishes when either stream finishes
/// {
///     let left = repeat(1).take(10);
///     let right = repeat(2);
///
///     let rrobin = |last: &mut PollNext| last.toggle();
///
///     let mut out = select_with_strategy(left, right, rrobin, ExitStrategy::WhenEitherFinish);
///
///     for _ in 0..10 {
///         // We should be alternating now.
///         assert_eq!(1, out.select_next_some().await);
///         assert_eq!(2, out.select_next_some().await);
